# 🧮 Simple C Calculator

A **basic calculator program in C** that runs in the terminal.  
It supports the following operations:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulo (`%`)

This project is a great starting point for beginners learning **C programming**, **switch statements**, and **basic arithmetic operators**.

⚠️ Error Handling

Division by Zero → Prints an error message instead of crashing.

Modulo by Zero → Prints an error message instead of crashing.

Invalid Operator → Prints "Error: Invalid operator."

📖 Concepts Covered

#include <stdio.h> → Standard I/O library

switch-case → Control flow in C

Typecasting → (int)n1 % (int)n2 for modulo operation

Error handling for invalid input
